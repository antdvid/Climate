1. The project depends on the following packages, please install and set the corresponding environment variables for installing path
Package_Name 	Environment_Variable	Version
MPI		MPI_DIR
PETSc		PETSC_DIR		>= 3.6
HDF4		HDF4_DIR		
GD		GD_DIR

2. This project is built with cmake tool.
	cmake .
	make

3. This project requires "MPI" library for parallel runs. The excutable file is in "climate" directory named "climate". There are several input files in climate directory and can be passed to the application for different experiments. For example:
	mpirun -np 8 climate -d 3 -p 2 2 2 -i in-entrainment -o out-entrainment

Explanation for the arguments:
	-np: number of processors
	-d:  dimension of the problem
	-p:  parallel partition on each direction
	-i:  input file name 
	-o:  output file name
